        <h1>FreeRTOS(Real Time Operating System)</h1>
        <h2>FreeRTOS Overview</h2>
        <p>FreeRTOS is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) that provides a multitasking kernel for embedded
            systems. It is designed to be highly efficient, portable, and scalable, making it a popular choice among
            developers working on real-time and resource-constrained applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Features and Capabilities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>KernelArchitecture:</h3> FreeRTOS follows a small footprint kernel architecture. It consists of a
                scheduler
                that manages tasks
                and provides essential services for task scheduling, synchronization, and inter-task communication. The
                kernel is implemented in C and assembly language, with a focus on simplicity, modularity, and
                portability.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Task Management:</h3> FreeRTOS allows developers to create multiple tasks, each representing a
                separate
                thread of execution.
                Tasks have different priorities, and the scheduler ensures that tasks with higher priority are executed
                first. Tasks can be preemptive or cooperative, and context switching between tasks is fast and
                efficient.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Scheduling:</h3>
                FreeRTOS provides different scheduling algorithms, including preemptive and time-sliced scheduling. The
                scheduler determines which task should run based on their priorities and ensures that tasks are executed
                in a deterministic and timely manner. The scheduling policy can be customized according to the specific
                requirements of the application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Memory Management:</h3>
                FreeRTOS provides memory management capabilities for dynamic memory allocation. It offers memory
                allocation schemes such as heap_1, heap_2, heap_3 and heap_4, allowing developers to choose the most
                suitable
                memory management strategy for their applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Tick Interrupt:</h3>
                FreeRTOS uses a tick interrupt to maintain its internal timekeeping and perform periodic tasks. The tick
                interrupt typically has a fixed time interval, which is configurable in the FreeRTOS configuration file.
                The tick interrupt is responsible for task switching and managing other time-related activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Ecosystem and Tools:</h3>
                FreeRTOS has a thriving community and a rich ecosystem of tools, middleware, and libraries. The FreeRTOS
                website offers extensive documentation, including reference manuals, API documentation, and application
                examples. Additionally, there are third-party tools and integrations available, such as integrated
                development environments (IDEs), debuggers, and trace tools, which enhance the development experience
                with FreeRTOS. We can further go through <a href="https://freertos.org/index.html">freeRTOS official
                    website</a> to know more about it.

        </ul>
        <p>
            FreeRTOS is widely used in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, consumer electronics,
            industrial automation, medical devices and IoT applications. Its versatility, efficiency, and open-source
            nature make it a
            powerful choice for developing real-time embedded systems.
        </p>
        <h2>FreeRTOS Task Management</h2>
        <p>In FreeRTOS, tasks are the basic units of execution that perform specific functions within an embedded
            system. They are responsible for carrying out various operations concurrently, allowing for efficient
            multitasking. Here's an overview of how to create and manage tasks in FreeRTOS, along with information about
            task priorities and synchronization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Task Creation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tasks are created using the xTaskCreate() function, which takes the task function, task name,
                        stack size, and priority as parameters.</li>
                    <li>The task function is a standard C function that implements the desired functionality of the
                        task.</li>
                    <li>The stack size determines the amount of memory allocated to the task for storing its local
                        variables and function call stack.</li>
                    <li>The priority defines the task's importance relative to other tasks and determines the order in
                        which tasks are scheduled for execution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Task Priorities and Scheduling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>FreeRTOS employs a preemptive priority-based scheduling algorithm, where tasks with higher
                        priorities take precedence over lower-priority tasks.</li>
                    <li>The scheduler ensures that the highest-priority task that is ready to run gets the CPU time.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tasks with equal priorities are scheduled in a round-robin manner to provide fairness.</li>
                    <li>Priority levels are represented as numeric values, where 0 is the lowest priority, and
                        configMAX_PRIORITIES-1 is the highest.</li>
                    <li>The priority of a task can be changed dynamically during runtime using the vTaskPrioritySet()
                        API.</li>

                        <pre><code>
                            //Task prioritization example

                                // task function

                                void vTask1(void *pvParameters) {

                                  // task functionality

                                }
                                //task function

                                void vTask2(void *pvParameters) {

                                void setup() {
                                  
                                    // creating Task 1

                                  xTaskCreate(vTask1, "Task1", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL);
                                
                                  // creating Task 2

                                  xTaskCreate(vTask2, "Task2", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL);
                                
                                  // starting the FreeRTOS scheduler

                                  vTaskStartScheduler();
                               
                                }
                                
                                void loop() {
                                  
                                }
                                
                                /*In this example, two tasks, vTask1 and vTask2, are created using xTaskCreate(). 
                                Task 1 has a higher priority than Task 2. Once the scheduler starts, the tasks will 
                                execute concurrently, with Task 1 taking precedence due to its higher priority. */

            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Task Deletion:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To delete a task, the vTaskDelete() API is used. This function terminates the calling task and
                        frees up the associated resources.</li>
                    <li>It's important to ensure that all necessary cleanup and resource release operations are
                        performed before deleting a task. For example: If the task dynamically allocated memory during
                        its execution using functions like pvPortMalloc() or malloc(), it is crucial to free that memory
                        before deleting the task. Failure to do so can lead to memory leaks and potential system
                        instability. Use the corresponding deallocation functions like vPortFree() or free() to release
                        the allocated memory.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Memory Management in FreeRTOS:</h2>
        <p>Memory management is a critical aspect of embedded systems development, and FreeRTOS provides several options
            for efficient memory usage. Here's a discussion on the memory management options in FreeRTOS and its
            significance in embedded systems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Dynamic Memory Allocation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>FreeRTOS allows dynamic memory allocation using standard C library functions such as 'malloc()'
                        and 'free()'.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic memory allocation enables flexibility in allocating and deallocating memory at runtime.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, it comes with overhead, such as memory fragmentation and potential memory leaks if not
                        managed carefully.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Memory Pools:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>FreeRTOS offers a memory management feature called memory pools, also known as fixed-size memory
                        block allocation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Memory pools provide a pre-allocated block of memory divided into fixed-size blocks, eliminating
                        fragmentation issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>Memory pools are efficient for tasks that require a fixed-size memory allocation pattern.
                    </li>
                    <li> FreeRTOS provides APIs such as xQueueCreateStatic() and xQueueCreateStaticRestricted() to
                        create and manage memory pools.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Efficient Memory Usage:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Embedded systems often have limited memory resources, and efficient memory usage is crucial for
                        optimal performance.
                    </li>
                    <li>FreeRTOS helps in managing memory efficiently by providing features like stack depth calculation
                        and stack overflow detection.
                    </li>
                    <li>It also offers stack overflow checking options, such as using stack canaries, to detect and
                        handle stack overflows.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Memory Management Best Practices:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> To ensure efficient memory usage in FreeRTOS applications, it is essential to follow best
                        practices:
                    </li>
                    <li>Avoid excessive dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Determine and allocate appropriate stack sizes for tasks based on their requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li> Use memory pools for fixed-size memory allocations whenever possible.
                    </li>
                    <li> Regularly review and optimize memory usage to minimize wastage and fragmentation.
                    </li>
                    <li> Enable stack overflow checking and handle stack overflows gracefully.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
